**On a scale of 1 to 10, how well rested and mentally ready were you when you began your work today?**

- 3

**How do you feel about your work on the summary assessment today?**

- It was dreadful.

**What aspect of your work today are you most proud of?**

- There is really nothing to be proud of here.

**Did you experience any extenuating circumstances that impeded your work? (e.g., my computer froze and it took me an hour to fix)**

- No. I relied way too heavily on others and using 'shapes' of methods, functions in my prep. When faced with no past code to compare to, no 'phone a friend', it made me realize my lack of understanding.

**Are you uncertain how well you did on the prompt?**

- No, I am certain, I did not fulfill any of the bmr. I did understand the prompt. I could remember the past Sprints that related to many parts of this, just not enought of the details on how to complete the prompts.

**Are there any aspects of the summary assessment you know you need extra support with?**

- I need to fill in all of my missing gaps. I need to practice all of these skills. I need more repetition. I am completely willing to work hard to make it happen!
