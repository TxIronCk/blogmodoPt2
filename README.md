# The Technical Assessment

Ready to put your skills to the test and have some full-stack hacking fun? This assessment is like a day-long solo sprint during which you will build a full-stack JavaScript application using the skills and technologies you worked with during the first half of the course. Expect to reinforce concepts and techniques you are familiar with and also to learn some new content.

1. Confirm that all communication applications and tools are turned off, closed, and put away.
1. Fork this repo and clone it. **Do not push your work** at any time during this assessment.

## Guidelines

You must manage your time effectively to complete this assessment. This assessment will be evaluated as if it was a coding challenge given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the **style and organization** of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

## Available resources

The ultimate goal of this assessment is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities as an engineer. Avoid anything that will obscure our ability to see your best efforts at work, or undermine that goal.

* You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Yeoman) or starter repos unless specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** use any resources created at Hack Reactor by other students or staff members
  * e.g. lectures, sprints and solutions, past assessments, checkpoints, etc.
* You **may** only use online resources specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** copy and paste from anywhere, online or otherwise

## Submitting Your Work

1. Make a final commit
1. **Fill out the `closing_comments` file.**
